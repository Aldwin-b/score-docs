# Faust

[Faust](https://faust.grame.fr) is a domain-specific programming language, tailored for writing digital signal processing code, for instance audio effects and synthesizers, super easily.

It is mainly developed at [Grame](https://grame.fr), with an international community of contributors.

Faust DSP files can be drag'n'dropped directly inside a score. This will compile the DSP and embed it as a signal processor in the score.
Additionnally, any `.dsp` file found recursively in the library folder will be detected and added under the `Faust` section in the [[Library|process library]].
