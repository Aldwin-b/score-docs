# ADSR

![ADSR]({{ site.img }}/reference/processes/adsr.png "ADSR") 

The ADSR process allows to create an attack-decay-sustain-release [envelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(music)) when an input happens.

Two inputs are possible: "Hold" will sustain for as long as it is pressed. Trigger will only perform the Attack, Decay and Release parts of the curve.
