# Edit processes

## Fullsize edit

Processes can be edited in full size. This is especially handy when you want to precisely edit a process such as an automation or mapping function.

To display the process in full size, double-click on the interval the process is attached to. Process is now displayed using *score* central panel full width. Note that if several processes are attached to an interval, open them in full size will display all at once juxtaposed as shown below (see the `Multiple processes` interval).

To exit full size mode (go back to parent scenario), click the desired node of the path displayed at the top or use the {% include shortcut.html content="Ctrl+Alt+â†‘" %} shortcut.
