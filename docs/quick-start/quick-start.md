This is the *score* quick start manual. The following pages will guide you through [*score* interface]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/quick-start/interface-overview.html) and general workflow. They also cover some of the basic elements available to author advanced scenarios such as [snapshots saving and recalling]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/quick-start/saving-and-recalling-devices-state.html), [automations]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/quick-start/writing-automations.html), as well as using [audio]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/quick-start/working-with-audio.html) and [video]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/quick-start/working-with-video.html) files.
