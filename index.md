# Score documentation

![score window](/score-docs/assets/images/score-2.png)

This is the documentation for *score* v3.0.0

Disclamer: documentation is currently worked on and as such is incomplete.
{: .text-red-300}

In the mean time, feel more than welcome to ask for help on the [Ossia.io forum](https://forum.ossia.io) or send a message on [Ossia score Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/OSSIA/score) where you will most likely find a handful of *score* users and developers.

You may also find some information watching these video tutorials (in French): [Score tutoriels](https://vimeo.com/ossia)
